# DOTS_Sandbox_V5
This repository serves as a playground for learning the DOTS ECS from Unity

# Description
The selfset task was, to use ECS to create a fast version of an existing Project where huge amounts of Gameobjects use a NavMesh to find a target and follow the path towards it. Also all Gameobjects (spheres) should roll only by force and so only use physics.
